## SideNotes
I am aware of how awful these algorithm is written in both time and space complexity in addition to the amount of bugs and unintended behaviour exist, however it is all I can do with the little time to work with at that time.

Also, probably should've used this [library](https://rayjasson98.github.io/Java-Graph-Algorithms-Visualizer/)  :/
